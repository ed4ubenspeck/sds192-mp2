## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

## Creating table to aggregate all contributions to each candidate, over all recorded years
```{r}
con_can <- candidates %>%
  inner_join(contributions, by = "cand_id") %>%
  select(fec_id = cand_id, cand_name, cand_party_affiliation, cand_election_yr, cand_office_district,cand_st1, cand_city, cand_state, cand_zip, cmte_id, committee_name = name, committee_city = city, committee_state = state, transaction_dt, transaction_amt, tran_id) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  filter(cand_election_yr >= 2010 | cand_election_yr <= 2016)
  
```

## Testing some functions
```{r}

cut_down_table <- function(state_arg){
  con_can %>%
  filter(cand_state == state_arg) %>%
  group_by(fec_id) %>%
  summarize( money_sum = sum(transaction_amt), total_com = n_distinct(cmte_id))
}

join_for_wins  <- function(state_arg){
  cut_down_table(state_arg) %>%
  inner_join(house_elections, by = "fec_id") %>%
    select(fec_id, money_sum, total_com, state, incumbent, candidate_name, party, ge_winner)
}

state_plot <- function(state_arg){
  join_for_wins(state_arg) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = total_com, y = money_sum)) + 
    geom_point()
}

example2 <- join_for_wins("AZ")
example3 <- join_for_wins("PA")
state_plot("PA")
```
