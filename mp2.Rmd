## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life!

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Creating table to aggregate all contributions to each candidate, over all recorded years
```{r}
con_can <- candidates %>%
  inner_join(contributions, by = "cand_id") %>%
  select(cand_id, cand_name, cand_party_affiliation, cand_election_yr, cand_office_district,cand_st1, cand_city, cand_state, cand_zip, cmte_id, committee_name = name, committee_city = city, committee_state = state, transaction_dt, transaction_amt, tran_id) %>%
  group_by(cand_name)
```

## Testing some plots
```{r}
test_plot <- ggplot(con_can, aes(x = cand_election_yr, y = transaction_amt)) + 
  geom_point()
```
